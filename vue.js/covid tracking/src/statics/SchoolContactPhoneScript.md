Dear [Name],

I am calling you today to notify that [NAEP Field Staff] tested positive for COVID-19.

Due to privacy concerns I am unable to provide any information about the [NAEP Field Staff] but we do believe that [you/your student] may have had close contact with this person and were exposed to COVID-19 during their infectious period. 

According to the CDC, anyone who has had close contact with an individual who has tested positive with COVID-19 needs to quarantine at home. The length of quarantine is a minimum of 7-10 days, depending on test results. If [you/your student] tested after day 5 and receive a negative test result, they can be released after 7 days of quarantine. 

If [you/your student] are not tested, you must quarantine for 10 days. In the meantime, if you have questions or would like more information you can visit:
