**We welcome you to the NAEP assessment!**

# NAEP NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT

The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is often referred to as The Nation’s Report Card. NAEP monitors what U.S. students know and can do in key subject areas at the elementary, middle, and high school levels and provides reliable student achievement profiles to educators and the public. NAEP is the largest continuing and nationally representative assessment to chart trends in student achievement across our nation. Since 1969, NAEP has been successful because of the support of teachers and school staff whose students participated in the assessment.

By being present and/or assisting during the assessment, you will help emphasize to the students the importance of their taking the test seriously. You have the advantage of knowing some or all of the students and the protocols of the school. The NAEP representative may ask for your assistance in these areas.

We respectfully ask for your cooperation in following these important guidelines while participating in NAEP to ensure the validity of the tests.

> Please do not answer any questions that any of the students may ask you about their test.

NAEP representatives are thoroughly trained to administer the tests to students to ensure the highest level of validity of the test results. They have a script they must read to the students verbatim to maintain the consistency of the instructions to students across the nation. NAEP representatives have been directed not to answer any questions the students may ask about their test questions but to encourage the students to do the best they can. In talking to a student about his or her test, you may be inadvertently compromising the results.

> Please do not talk to anyone during the assessment, even the NAEP representative.

Any conversation could be disruptive to students and may affect their ability to concentrate on the test.

> Please do not look at the students’ test booklets or test items.

The security of the assessment items is a very important part of NAEP. No one other than the student is to read the questions. NAEP representatives have signed a security affidavit and, since you have access to the assessment booklets or test items, we ask the same of you. You are welcome to view sample questions at https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/subjectareas.aspx, which provides examples of assessment questions asked in previous years in all NAEP subjects. You may also download Sample Question Booklets at https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/about/booklets.aspx, which include test background, sample questions, and all questionnaire items.

**If assisting with an accommodation session, you may:**

- encourage students to review their answers upon completion of a section;
- allow students to take a break between sections when the NAEP representative indicates they can;
- make minor modifications to the script to shorten or simplify the introductory statements; and
- answer student questions regarding the student questionnaire section of the booklet, the booklet directions, and the recording of answers.

**If assisting with an accommodation session, you may not:**

- provide assistance on assessment items. (Students may seek validation on certain items; you may not indicate verbally or nonverbally your recommendations. Instead you are encouraged to remind students to answer the questions to the best of their ability.) Or,
- allow any student to use accommodations/adaptations on the assessment that are not indicated in the student's IEP/Section 504 Plan or that are not normally used by the student during testing.
